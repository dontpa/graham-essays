**Check out the [releases page] for the latest build, updated daily.**

Download the _complete collection_ of +200 essays from [Paul Graham] website and export them in [EPUB], and Markdown for easy [AFK] reading. It turned out to be a whooping +500k words. I used the RSS originally made by [Aaron Swartz] [shared] by PG himself, `feedparser`, `html2text`, `htmldate` and `Unidecode` libraries for data cleaning and acquisition. 

## Dependencies for MacOS

On macOS you need [brew] in order to install the dependencies listed in the Makefile.

## Usage

Run the [Makefile](./Makefile) in the root directory using:

```bash
make
```

### Current Essays

Here's a [list] of the current essays included, and an [EPUB].
